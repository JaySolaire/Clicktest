#Clicktest
This program was designed to prevent the screen from falling asleep. It simply clicks on the designated point in the window every ten seconds. The code is easily modified, in terms of both speed and location, so anyone could use this as aclicking macro. 
As proof of its modifiability, chaos.py was designed. This continuously moves to a random point on the screen and double clicks, as fast as the computer allows. It also makes a fun beep for added enjoyment. Please do not blame me for any trouble that it causes ;)
